				<div class="bio">
					Hi, I'm Marco Otero, a Computer Science sophomore at Georgetown University.
I thrive on building from the ground up whether it's designing a 2D game in C++ or constructing a PC. My passion lies in exploring the intersection of hardware and software, and I seek out projects that challenge me to learn and innovate. Beyond coding, I enjoy disassembling, testing, and rebuilding, always curious to understand the inner working of things and how to improve them.

							Space Shooter
						</h3>
						<p class = "project1-description">After wanting to deepen my understanding of game development, I built a 2D space shooter in C++ using SFML. The game simulates player movement, enemy AI, shooting mechanics, and collision detection in a modular, object-oriented architecture. I engineered features like dynamic background titling, directional shooting based on mouse position, health and scoring systems, and enemy destruction animations.</p>

							Reddit Bot

							Route
						</h3>
						<p class = "project3-description">Crafted a word-ladder puzzle where players transform a start word into a target word by changing one letter at a time. Built a Node.js script to generate a trie-based dictionary for fast, real-time word validation. On the front end, implemented responsive UI with animated feedback for each guess, hint and “how to play” modal dialogs, and a guess tracking system showing both current progress and target metrics. Deployed on my website with live demo and open-source repository.</p>

								<div class="learning-title">2D RPG Game</div>
								<p>Developing top-down 2D RPG using C++ and UE5 and Godot. My work includes programming core gameplay systems such as custom character movement on the XY plane, precise Flipbook animation switcihing, and dynamic Y-sorting for accurate depth layering. I also design and draw the pixel art assets including the modular tilemaps, sprite sheets, and environmental elements like trees and terrain.</p>

								<div class="learning-title">OpenGL</div>
								<p>Exploring shader compilation vertex buffer management, sprite animation, and camera handling all written from scratch. By desigining classes like Texture, Mesh. Sprite, and Shader in C++, I am gaining experience with GPU pipelines, OpenGL state management and modular software design. It is part of my broader goal to master low-level systems and rendering workflows beyond standard game engines.</p>
